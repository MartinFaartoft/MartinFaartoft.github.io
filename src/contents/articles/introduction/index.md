In which we find out what the point of this whole thing is.

I am currently studying an MSc in Computer Science. Part of the mandatory curriculum is a course called 'Global Software Development', in which groups of students from different countries, are tasked with writing non-trivial software systems in a programming language called Eiffel.

I know next to nothing about Eiffel.

Eiffel is an old, and somewhat obscure language. Google searches usually come back with results related to the tower in Paris, or if you are really lucky, with a result related to your problem, explaining how to solve it in Eiffel version 6.x, when the syntax was significantly different. (current version is 7.3).

So to make the Internet an infinitesimally better place, I will write a series of posts about how to program in Eiffel 7.3.

Apologies in advance for all the things I will get wrong. I'm learning this stuff as I go along.
